It would not be very sweet—just enough to keep it from feeling harsh—so that what you remember most is the cold, clear freshness it leaves on your tongue. The surface would be smooth and slightly glossy, with soft swirls frozen into it, like gentle waves that have suddenly become still.

The drink would be clear and calm when you look at it, with the ice slowly melting and barely making a sound. It would be something you drink alone by a window, when the sky is dark and quiet, giving you a sense of peaceful distance. It would feel refreshing and clean, but also a little lonely, like a cold breeze that passes through a quiet town while everyone is asleep.","The soundtrack would start softly, with a slow, flowing melody played by strings or piano. The notes would keep circling and rising, repeating in gentle spirals that grow a little stronger each time.

This title would be based on its theme of time being only so limited and you only have so much until your time here is over. I feel like the first few songs would be about enjoying life. The first song could be nice and sweet representing a person being born into this world. Then the next few songs would be themed about your childhood and growing up. Some of these songs would be bright and some would be kind of sad representing mistakes. However, they would still be upbeat, representing a person cherishing their memories whether good or bad. Then somewhere in the middle of the soundtrack, you would be hit with a hard sombre song. This song would represent a person realizing that there is only so much time left until their time here is over. This song would be drastic representing despair and the songs to follow would be more and more dreadful as the person realizes there is nothing they can do as the hours tick by and they realize they have less and less time. However, the final song or two would then be bittersweet even uplifting. It would represent a person finally coming to terms with what is to come next. Coming to terms with the fact that their life here will eventually come to an end. However, they accept the fact and decide to live their life the best they can. "
